Here are **seven high-level AWS + Apache Airflow data‚Äëengineering projects**, each tied to a **Kaggle dataset** to help you prototype production‚Äëlike pipelines fully:

---

### 1. **Spotify Streaming Analytics(Vijay)**

**Dataset**: Spotify Kaggle dataset (artist, album, track features)
**Overview**:

* Airflow DAG ingests raw CSV/JSON into **S3**.
* Use **AWS Glue ETL** (PySpark) to clean and transform.
* Store processed data as Parquet in S3, catalog via Glue Data Catalog.
* Query via **Athena**, load summarized analytics into **Redshift** or leave in S3.
* (Optional) Visualize in **QuickSight**.
  ‚úÖ Teaches Airflow orchestration, S3 data lake, Glue, Athena, Redshift and schema/catalog. Inspired by AWS Spotify project pipelines ([LinkedIn][1]).

---

### 2. **Reddit Comments Pipeline**

**Dataset**: Kaggle Reddit comment datasets (by subreddit or timeframe)
**Overview**:

* Airflow extracts Reddit data via API or CSV.
* Pre‚Äëtransform with PostgreSQL/Athena for cleaning.
* ETL with **Glue** jobs (flatten JSON), store in S3.\*\*
* Query in Athena, optionally load final tables to **Redshift**.
* Build dashboards to track comment volume or sentiment over time.
  This follows well‚Äëknown Reddit ETL patterns using Airflow, Glue, S3, Athena, Redshift pipeline ([Medium][2], [DataCamp][3]).

---

### 3. **Retail Delivery Performance on Olist Dataset**

**Dataset**: Olist Brazilian e-commerce Kaggle data
**Overview**:

* Load Olist CSV files into staging in S3.
* Airflow runs Spark/Spark‚ÄëSQL jobs (via Glue or EMR) to identify orders missing delivery deadlines.
* Upload cleaned results back to S3 for analytics.
* Catalog tables and schedule recurring DAG.
  Example from a GitHub-based Airflow+Spark pipeline ([GitHub][4]).

---

### 4. **Credit‚ÄëCard Fraud Detection Stream + Batch**

**Dataset**: Kaggle credit‚Äëcard transactions dataset (real or simulated)
**Overview**:

* Use Airflow to trigger both batch ingestion and real‚Äëtime streaming via mock Kinesis/Lambda.
* Batch jobs run Glue or Spark to build fact & dimension tables (star schema) in Redshift.
* Real‚Äëtime pipeline flags anomalies, writes to DynamoDB or S3.
* BI via **QuickSight** for fraud alerts/dashboard.
  Adapted from credit‚Äëcard streaming/batch pipelines on AWS ([Medium][5]).

---

### 5. **Weather Time Series Pipeline**

**Dataset**: Kaggle WeatherBench or NOAA weather CSV datasets
**Overview**:

* Airflow pushes daily weather data ingestion from public dataset (e.g. NOAA).
* Use Glue to normalize and transform time series, compute aggregates (daily averages).
* Store data in S3; catalog via Glue.
* Perform queries via Athena or load to Redshift/Aurora for downstream use.
* Optionally feed into an anomaly‚Äëdetection ML model or trend analytics dashboard.

---

### 6. **IoT Sensor Anomaly Detection**

**Dataset**: Synthetic IoT sensor data from Kaggle or generated via Faker, formatted as time series.
**Overview**:

* Airflow orchestrates periodic ingestion of sensor CSV into S3.
* Glue transforms and enriches data (time normalization, missing value imputation).
* Build Spark‚Äëbased anomaly detection job (e.g. Z‚Äëscore, clustering) via EMR or Glue.
* Store flagged anomalies in S3 or Redshift; send alerts via SNS/Lambda.
* Visualize sensor metrics and anomaly counts over time.
  Inspired by IoT anomaly detection pipelines on AWS ([arXiv][6]).

---

### 7. **Public Transport Demand Aggregation**

**Dataset**: Kaggle open transportation or city transit logs (e.g. NYC taxi, London transport)
**Overview**:

* Airflow pulls raw CSV or API data into S3 bucket.
* Use Glue/Spark to clean, aggregate rides by time, route, geolocation.
* Enrich with external data (weather, events).
* Store processed tables in S3; catalog.
* Query in Athena or Redshift for demand‚Äëforecasting dashboards.
  Teaches scalable ETL, joins, enrichment, and orchestration skills.

### üìÅ Kaggle File Structure Recommendations

Each project should include in your repo (e.g. on GitHub):

* **/data/**: raw Kaggle files, with metadata.
* **/dags/**: Airflow DAG definitions (.py files).
* **/etl/**: Glue/Spark scripts.
* **/notebooks/**: Jupyter exploratory analysis and SQL queries with pandas or PySpark.
* **README.md**: Project overview, architecture diagram, setup, how to run DAGs, dependencies.
* **environment.yml** or requirements.txt for reproducibility.

### üß∞ Airflow Features & Version Note

Use **Apache Airflow 3.0** where possible‚Äîit offers **DAG versioning**, React-based UI, improved backfill management, and event-driven scheduling for more production-grade workflows ([Wikipedia][7]).
